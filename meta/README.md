# Metadata scripts

The function 'BIDSify' converts your data into BIDS format which you MUST do before uploading it on OSF.

The script file_naming_check checks that your data follows the correct naming convention and that all files are present.
Run this script BEFORE you upload your data on OSF to avoid uploading data that is incompatible with the tACS Challenge

All scripts were written by Yifan Shen and Simon Hanslmayr (University of Glasogw, School of Psychology and Neuroscience)
