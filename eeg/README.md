# EEG data analysis
The Matlab scripts in this folder name analyse the resting EEG data and extract the IAF (Individual Alpha Frequency, or Peak Alpha Frequency) from the data according to the procedure described in the registerd report. You will need to install this toolbox for it to work --> https://github.com/corcorana/restingIAF

All scripts were written by Yifan Shen and Simon Hanslmayr (University of Glasogw, School of Psychology and Neuroscience)
